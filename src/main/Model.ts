    //Then this method fires an event for both this Model instance and all Model
    //instances, indicating that the given property has been updated and providing
    //the previous value of the property and the current value of the property.

    //MFC does something a little similar in their site code, check out the
    //StoreUserHash method in their top.html.  In their case they are renaming
    //many of the properties such that "uid" becomes "user_id", for instance.
    //We're not doing that here, which could potentially lead to some confusion
    //if you're comparing a Model instance to how MFC stores users in g_hUsers.
    //But my feeling is that what we're doing here is closer to the actual messages
    //coming from the server, and those are what we deal with in MFCAuto rather
    //than the specific quirks of MFC's own client side abstractions.
    //
    //Finally, there are a few bitmasks that are sent as part of the chat messages.
    //Just like StoreUserHash, we will decode those bitmasks here for convenience
    //as they contain useful information like if a private is true private or
    //if guests or basics are muted.
